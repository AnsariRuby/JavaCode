// Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
// It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
// We are achieving inheritance by using extends keyword. Inheritance is also known as "is-a" relationship.
